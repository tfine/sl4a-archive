Sl4A Script for Taking Photographs in Historical Archives

This script allows one to make the filenames and directory structure of a series of photos on Android correspond to the box and folders numbers or names of an archive. A stand-alone android application might be useful for such a process, but I couldn't find one, and therefore created this Python script which one can run in "QPython3," the python environment that runs on Android and which can access the camera using SL4A scripting.
